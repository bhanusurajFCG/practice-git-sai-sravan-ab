Hello, hi professor. 
I am really glad to enrol into your course, I want to learn the concepts of ML and data mining to my fullest capacity. 
One recommendation I would have is to make the class room learning more interactive by asking questions based on topic that is being taught, I hope this could increase students attention towards the lecture besides the actual attendance. 
And awarding an extra credit for studentâ€™s participation will make this effective towards keeping the class quiet. 

Thank you
